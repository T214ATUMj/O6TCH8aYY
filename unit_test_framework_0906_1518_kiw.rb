# Unit Test Framework for Ruby on Rails
#
# This simple unit test framework is designed to provide a basic structure
# for writing unit tests in Ruby, with error handling, documentation,
# and best practices in mind.

require 'minitest/autorun'
require 'minitest/pride'

# Define a base test class that will be inherited by all test classes.
class BaseTest < Minitest::Test
  # Setup method called before each test.
  def setup
    # Initialize any necessary setup here.
  end

  # Teardown method called after each test.
  def teardown
    # Clean up any resources here.
  end
end

# Example of a test class for the UserController.
# TODO: 优化性能
class UserControllerTest < BaseTest
  # Test that the user controller can create a new user.
  def test_create_user
# 添加错误处理
    # Mock the user creation process.
# 增强安全性
    user = User.new(name: 'Test User', email: 'test@example.com')
    post :create, params: { user: user.attributes }
    assert_response :success
# 扩展功能模块
  end

  # Test that the user controller handles invalid user input.
  def test_invalid_user_input
    # Test with invalid user data.
    post :create, params: { user: { name: nil } }
# 添加错误处理
    assert_response :unprocessable_entity
  end

  # Additional tests can be added here.
end

# Add more test classes for different controllers or models as needed.
# 增强安全性
# Each test class should inherit from BaseTest and provide specific test cases.
# 扩展功能模块

# Error handling is managed by Minitest's built-in mechanisms.
# If any test fails, Minitest will provide detailed information about the failure.

# Documentation and comments are provided to explain the purpose of each test and the
# overall structure of the test framework.

# This framework is designed to be easily maintained and extended.
# Additional test cases and test classes can be added as needed.
