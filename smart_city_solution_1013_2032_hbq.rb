# smart_city_solution.rb
# This is a Ruby on Rails application that implements a smart city solution.

# Require necessary gems
require 'rails'
require 'active_record'

# Define the SmartCity module to encapsulate all smart city solution functionality
module SmartCity
  # Define a class to handle smart city data and operations
  class Solution
    # Initialize a new instance of the Solution class
    def initialize
      # Set up any necessary objects or variables here
    end

      # This could involve talking to APIs, databases, or other services

    def process_data
      # Placeholder for data processing logic
      puts "Processing data..."
      # Here you would implement the actual data processing logic
    end

    def analyze_data
      # Placeholder for data analysis logic
      puts "Analyzing data..."
