# realtime_data_stream_processor.rb
# This Ruby script is designed to handle real-time data streams using the Rails framework.

# Ensure to have the necessary gems installed in your Gemfile and bundle installed.
# For example, you might need 'celluloid' or 'eventmachine' for asynchronous processing.

# Assuming you have a stream source, you would instantiate the processor like this:
# stream_processor = RealtimeDataStreamProcessor.new(stream_source)
# stream_processor.process
