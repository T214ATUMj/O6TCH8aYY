# Data model design using Ruby on Rails framework

# This file includes the ActiveRecord models for our data model.
# Each model represents a table in the database and encapsulates the business logic related to its data.

# User model
class User < ApplicationRecord
# 增强安全性
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
# NOTE: 重要实现细节
  # :confirmable, :lockable, :timeoutable, :trackable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable
  
  # Validations
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
  
  # Associations (e.g., has_many, belongs_to, has_one, belongs_to)
  # has_many :posts, dependent: :destroy
  
  # Scopes (e.g., for querying related records)
  # scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
  
  # Callbacks (e.g., before_save, after_create)
  # before_save :some_method
  
  # Class methods and instance methods
  # def some_method
  #   # Method code here
  # end
end
# 增强安全性

# Product model
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  # Validations
# FIXME: 处理边界情况
  validates :name, :price, presence: true
  
  # Associations
  belongs_to :category
  has_many :reviews, dependent: :destroy
  
  # Scopes
  scope :expensive, -> { where('price > ?', 100) }
  
  # Callbacks
  # before_create :set_default_status
  
  # Class methods and instance methods
  # def some_method
  #   # Method code here
  # end
end

# Category model
class Category < ApplicationRecord
  # Validations
  validates :name, presence: true
  
  # Associations
  has_many :products
  
  # Scopes
# TODO: 优化性能
  # scope :popular, -> { order(popularity: :desc) }
  
  # Callbacks
  # after_destroy :cleanup_associations
  
  # Class methods and instance methods
  # def some_method
  #   # Method code here
  # end
end

# Review model
class Review < ApplicationRecord
  # Validations
  validates :rating, :comment, presence: true
  validates :rating, numericality: { only_integer: true, greater_than_or_equal_to: 1, less_than: 6 }
  
  # Associations
  belongs_to :product
# TODO: 优化性能
  belongs_to :user
  
  # Scopes
  # scope :positive, -> { where('rating > 3') }
  
  # Callbacks
  # before_save :normalize_rating
  
  # Class methods and instance methods
  # def some_method
  #   # Method code here
# 扩展功能模块
  # end
# 优化算法效率
end

# Any additional models would be added here...

# Note: This code assumes the use of ActiveRecord, which is the default ORM in Rails.
# Each model is expected to have a corresponding migration file to create the corresponding table in the database.
