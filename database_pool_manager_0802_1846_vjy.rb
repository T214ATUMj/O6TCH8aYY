# database_pool_manager.rb
# This Ruby script demonstrates a simple database connection pool management system
# using Rails ActiveRecord connections.

require 'active_record'
require 'connection_pool'

# Establish a connection pool for ActiveRecord.
# It allows us to manage multiple ActiveRecord connections in a thread-safe manner.
class DatabasePoolManager
  # Initialize the connection pool with a specified size.
  def initialize(pool_size = 5)
    @pool_size = pool_size
    @connection_pool = ConnectionPool.new(size: @pool_size) do
      # Establish a new ActiveRecord connection each time.
      ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
      ActiveRecord::Base.connection
    end
  end

  # Fetch a connection from the pool.
  def fetch_connection
    @connection_pool.with do |connection|
      # Perform operations with the connection here.
      # For demonstration, just return the connection object.
      connection
    end
  rescue ActiveRecord::ConnectionTimeoutError => e
    # Handle connection timeout error and attempt to re-fetch a connection.
    puts "Connection timeout, attempting to re-fetch: #{e.message}"
    fetch_connection
  end

  # Returns the connection pool for inspection.
  def pool
    @connection_pool
  end

  # Closes all connections in the pool.
  def close_pool
    @connection_pool.shutdown { |conn| conn.close rescue nil }
  end
end

# Example usage of the DatabasePoolManager
if __FILE__ == $0
  # Setup ActiveRecord to use a SQLite database for demonstration.
  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
    adapter: 'sqlite3',
    database: ':memory:'
  )

  # Create the DatabasePoolManager instance with a pool size of 10.
  pool_manager = DatabasePoolManager.new(10)

  # Fetch a connection from the pool and print its object_id to demonstrate its use.
  connection = pool_manager.fetch_connection
  puts "Fetched connection with object_id: #{connection.object_id}"

  # Close the pool when done.
  pool_manager.close_pool
