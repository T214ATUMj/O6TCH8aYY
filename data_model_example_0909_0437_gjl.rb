# DataModelExample.rb
# This Ruby on Rails application demonstrates a simple data model

# User Model
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # User has a name and an email attribute
  # Validations ensure that both attributes are present and the email is unique
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }

  # Associations can be defined here
  # For example, a user might have many posts
  # has_many :posts
end

# Post Model
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  # A Post belongs to a User
  # This means a post is associated with a user who created it
  belongs_to :user, class_name: 'User', foreign_key: 'user_id'

  # A post has a title and content
  # Validations ensure that both attributes are present
  validates :title, presence: true
  validates :content, presence: true

  # Scope for published posts
  scope :published, -> { where(published: true) }
end

# Comment Model
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  # A Comment belongs to both a Post and a User
  belongs_to :post, class_name: 'Post', foreign_key: 'post_id'
  belongs_to :user, class_name: 'User', foreign_key: 'user_id'

  # A comment has content and it is validated for presence
  validates :content, presence: true
end

# Error Handling Example
begin
  # Example of an operation that might fail
  user = User.find_by(email: 'nonexistent@example.com')
rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
  # Handle the error if the user does not exist
  puts 'User not found.'
end

# Usage Documentation
# To create a new user, use the User model:
# User.create(name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com')
#
# To create a new post, use the Post model:
# post = Post.new(title: 'Example Post', content: 'This is an example post.', user_id: user.id)
# post.save
#
# To create a new comment, use the Comment model:
# comment = Comment.new(content: 'This is an example comment.', post_id: post.id, user_id: user.id)
# comment.save
