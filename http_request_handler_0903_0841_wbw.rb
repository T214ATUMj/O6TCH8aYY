# http_request_handler.rb
# This is an HTTP request handler written in Ruby using the Rails framework.
# It demonstrates a basic RESTful controller structure with error handling and documentation.

class HttpRequestController < ApplicationController
  # GET /http_request_handler
  def index
    # This action handles GET requests to the /http_request_handler route.
    render json: { message: 'Welcome to the HTTP Request Handler!' }
  end

  # POST /http_request_handler
  def create
    # This action handles POST requests to the /http_request_handler route.
    # It expects a JSON payload with a 'data' key.
    data = params[:data]
    begin
      # Process the data
      result = process_data(data)
      render json: result
    rescue => e
      # Handle any errors that occur during data processing
      render json: { error: e.message }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  # A private method to process the incoming data.
  # This is where you would implement your business logic.
  def process_data(data)
    # Placeholder for data processing logic
    # Ensure that data is valid and perform necessary operations
    if data.nil? || data.empty?
      raise 'Invalid data received.'
    else
      # Assuming data is valid, return a success message or processed result
      { success: 'Data processed successfully.', data: data }
    end

  # Additional helper methods can be defined here for better organization and maintainability.
