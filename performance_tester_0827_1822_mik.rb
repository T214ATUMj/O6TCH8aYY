# performance_tester.rb
# This script is designed to perform a simple performance test on a Ruby on Rails application.
# It measures the time taken to execute a specific action, such as rendering a view or making a database query.

require 'benchmark'
require 'active_support/all'

# A simple class to handle the performance testing
class PerformanceTester
  # Method to perform the performance test
  # @param action [Proc] the action to be measured
  # @param iterations [Integer] the number of times the action should be repeated
  def initialize(action, iterations = 10)
    @action = action
    @iterations = iterations
  end

  # Run the test and print the results
  def run
    total_time = 0
    @iterations.times do
      start_time = Benchmark.realtime do
        @action.call
      end
      total_time += start_time
    end
    average_time = total_time / @iterations
    puts "Average time per iteration: #{average_time.round(4)} seconds"
  end
end

# Example usage of the PerformanceTester class
# Define the action you want to test
action = Proc.new do
  # Simulate an action, for example, rendering a view or making a database query
  Rails.cache.fetch('some_key', expires_in: 10.minutes) do
    # Simulated expensive operation
    sleep(0.5) # Simulate a delay of 0.5 seconds
    'Result of expensive operation'
  end
end

# Create an instance of PerformanceTester with the action and the number of iterations
tester = PerformanceTester.new(action, 5)

# Run the performance test
tester.run
