# automated_test_suite.rb
# This script sets up a simple automated test suite using RSpec, a popular testing framework for Ruby on Rails.

require 'rspec'
require 'rspec/autorun'

# Assuming we have a User model and a UsersController as part of the Rails application.
# We will write tests for these components.

# User model test
RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
  # Test for user creation
  it 'creates a new user' do
    user = User.create(name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com')
    expect(user).to be_valid
  end

  # Additional model tests can be added here...
end

# UsersController test
RSpec.describe UsersController, type: :controller do
  # Test for new action
  it 'responds with success' do
    get :new
    expect(response).to have_http_status(:success)
  end

  # Additional controller tests can be added here...
end

# Note: This is a minimal example. In a real-world scenario,
# you would have more comprehensive tests covering
# various scenarios and edge cases.

# To run the test suite, save this file and execute it using:
# bundle exec rspec automated_test_suite.rb
