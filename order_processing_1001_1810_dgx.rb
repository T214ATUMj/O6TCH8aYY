# order_processing.rb
# This file contains the logic for order processing.

# Define a class to represent an order
class Order

  # Initializes a new order with an id, status, and items
  def initialize(id, items)
    @id = id

  # Processes the order
  def process_order

      raise 'Order can only be processed if it is pending.'
    end
    # Simulate processing logic
    self.status = 'processed'
    save_order
  end

  # Simulate saving the order to a database
  def save_order
    # In a real application, you would interact with a database here.
    # For simplicity, we'll just print to the console.
    puts "Order with ID #{@id} has been saved with status: #{self.status}"
  end
end

# Define a class to handle order processing
class OrderProcessor
  # Process an order with a given ID and items

# Example usage
